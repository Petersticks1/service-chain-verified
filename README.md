Decentralized Military Service Record & Reward System (Powered by Hedera)

MilitaryChain is a Web3 platform designed to digitize and decentralize military service management, recognition, and rewards using Hedera Hashgraph.
It allows military organizations to issue verifiable service NFTs, token-based rewards, and maintain transparent service histories through smart contracts, Mirror Node APIs, and HashPack wallet integration.

⚔️ Overview

MilitaryChain empowers armed forces and veterans by providing a tamper-proof, blockchain-based record system.
Each service milestone — such as rank promotion, mission completion, or award recognition — is represented as a unique NFT minted on Hedera Token Service (HTS).
Service members can also earn MIL Tokens (fungible HTS tokens) as on-chain rewards for verified accomplishments.

💠 Key Features
1. NFT Service Badges (HTS Integration)

Mint NFTs using Hedera Token Service (HTS) to represent ranks, achievements, and medals.

Each NFT includes metadata (service ID, rank, mission name, and date).

Immutable proof of service stored on Hedera.

2. Smart Contract-Based Verification

Deploy Hedera Smart Contracts (Solidity) to manage rank progression, mission validation, and automated reward distribution.

Contracts ensure transparent and auditable verification of all service events.

3. Reward Token System

Introduce MIL Token, a Hedera-based fungible token used for rewarding active duty personnel and veterans.

Smart contracts handle token minting, transfer, and redemption securely.

4. Mirror Node Transparency

Leverage Hedera Mirror Node API to provide public access to service record verification, mission logs, and NFT histories.

Enables real-time tracking of service-related transactions.
